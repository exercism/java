## Overview

This guide covers contributing to the Java track.  If you are new, this guide is for you.

If, at any point, you're having any trouble, pop in the [Gitter exercism/java room](https://gitter.im/exercism/java) or the [Gitter exercism/dev room](https://gitter.im/exercism/dev) for help.


## Before Making Your Pull Request

Hi! Thanks for contributing to the Exercism Java track!

Before opening your pull request, please review the track policies linked below and make sure your changes comply with them all. This helps us focus our review time on the more important aspects of your changes.

- [Prefer instance methods](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/master/POLICIES.md#prefer-instance-methods)
- [Starter implementations](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/master/POLICIES.md#starter-implementations)
- [Ignore noninitial tests](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/master/POLICIES.md#ignore-noninitial-tests)
- [Multiple file submissions](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/master/POLICIES.md#multiple-file-submissions)

One last thing to note before you get started. When you fork the repository and you want to sync your fork, you can perform a [`git rebase`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase). This is preferred over merging the changes because merging leads to a dirty commit history whereas performing a rebase adds in those changes without making extra commit messages. However, this is only preferred, so don't worry about it too much.

## Contributing With Minimal Setup

First things first: by contributing to Exercism, you are making this learning tool that much better and improving our industry as a whole... thank you!!!

To submit a fix for an existing exercise or port an exercise to Java with the least amount of setup:

1. **Ensure you have the basic Java tooling installed:**  JDK 1.8+, an editor and Gradle 2.x.

   (see [exercism.io: Installing Java](http://exercism.io/languages/java/installation))
-  **Setup a branch on a fork of [exercism/java](https://github.com/exercism/java) on your computer.**

   See [GitHub Help: Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).  Use those instructions (in conjunction with the [Git Basics doc](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/git-basics.md)) to:
   * "fork" a repository on GitHub;
   - install `git`;
   - "clone" a copy of your fork;
   - configure an "upstream remote" (in this case, `exercism/java`);
   - create a branch to house your work
-  **Write the codes.**  Do your work on that branch you just created.

   The [Getting Familiar With the Codebase](#getting-familiar-with-the-codebase) section, below, is an orientation.
-  **Commit, push and create a pull request.**

   Something like:
   ```
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "(An intention-revealing commit message)"
   $ git push
   ```

   The Git Basics doc has a section on [commit messages](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/git-basics.md#commit-messages) that provides practical advice on crafting meaningful commit messages.
-  **Verify that your work passes all tests.**  When you create a pull request (PR), GitHub triggers a build on Travis CI.  Your PR will not be merged unless those tests pass.

## Getting Familiar With the Codebase

There are two objectives to the design of this build:

1. when a problem is built from within the `exercism/java` repo (i.e. when you, the contributor, are developing the exercise), the tests run against the reference solution;
2. when a problem is built outside the `exercism/java` repo (when a participant is solving the exercise), the tests run against the "main" code.

This repo is a multi-project gradle build.

### The `exercises` Module

This is the top-level module, contained in the `exercises` directory.  It is a container for the problem sub-modules.

  * its `build.gradle` points the "main" sourceset to the reference solution.
  * its `settings.gradle` names each of the subprojects, one for each problem in the set.

### The Problem Submodules

The `exercises` subdirectory contains all of the problem submodules.
Each problem/submodule is a subdirectory of the same name as its slug.

  * its `build.gradle` names dependencies required to work that problem.

Each problem/submodule has three source sets:

* `src/test/java/` — a test suite defining the edges of the problem
* `.meta/src/reference/java/` — a reference solution that passes all the tests
* `src/main/java/` — starter source files, if required/desired *(this directory usually only has a `.keep` file in it)*.

## Advanced: Complete Local Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you proceed, please ensure that you have `jq` (library that parses JSON) & `ruby` installed on your machine.

##### Debian Linux
`sudo apt-get install jq ruby-full`

##### Mac OSX
`brew install jq ruby`

If you are going to make significant contribution(s) to the track, you might find it handy to have a complete local install of exercism on your computer.  This way, you can run the full suite of tests without having to create/update a PR.

The easiest way to achieve this is simply use the `bin/journey-test.sh` script.  However, you may want to perform other tests, depending on what you are doing.  You can do so by duplicating the setup performed by the `bin/journey-test.sh` script.

### Tip: `gradle clean` before `exercism fetch`

If you `exercism fetch` after doing a build, the CLI will fail with the following error message:

```
$ exercism fetch java bob
2015/09/06 15:03:21 an internal server error was received.
Please file a bug report with the contents of 'exercism debug' at: https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues
```

and if you review the logs of your x-api, you'll find:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Sep/2015:15:20:56 -0700] "GET /v2/exercises/java/bob HTTP/1.1" 500 514949 0.2138
2015-09-06 15:21:01 - JSON::GeneratorError - source sequence is illegal/malformed utf-8:
```

This is because some files generated by the build can't be served from the x-api.  This is by design: the CLI does not serve binaries.  To fix this, simply make sure you do a clean in your `exercism/java` repo before you fetch:

```
cd ~/workspace/exercism/java/exercises
gradle clean
cd ~/workspace/exercism/exercises
exercism fetch java bob
```
