# About

The key thing to remember about Java strings is that they are immutable objects representing text as a sequence of Unicode characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.).
Double quotes are used to define a `String` instance:

```java
String fruit = "Apple";
```

Manipulating a string can be done using method of class [`String`][string-class].
As string values can never change after having been defined, all string manipulation methods will return a new string.

A string is delimited by double quote (`"`) characters.
Some special characters need escaping using the backslash (`\`) character.
Characters to be escaped in Java:

- `"`
- `\`

```java
String escaped = "c:\\test.txt";
// => c:\test.txt
```

Finally, there are many ways to concatenate a string.
The simplest one is the `+` operator:

```java
String name = "Jane";
"Hello " + name + "!";
// => "Hello Jane!"
```

For any string formatting more complex than simple concatenation, `String.format` method is preferred.

```java
String name = "Jane";
String.format("Hello %s!",name);
// => "Hello Jane!"
```

Other possibilities are:

- use [`StringBuilder` class][string-builder]
- use [`String.concat` method][string-concat]
