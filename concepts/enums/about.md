# About

An _enum type_ is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
Common examples include compass directions (values of `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, and `WEST`) and the days of the week.

Because they are constants, the names of an enum type's fields are in uppercase letters.

## Defining an enum type

In the Java programming language, you define an enum type by using the `enum` keyword.
For example, you would specify a days-of-the-week enum type as:

```java
public enum DayOfWeek {
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
}
```

You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.
That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and data sets where you know all possible values at compile time - for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, and so on.

## Using an enum type

Here is some code that shows you how to use the `DayOfWeek` enum defined above:

```java
public class Shop {
    public String getOpeningHours(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek) {
        switch (dayOfWeek) {
            case MONDAY:
            case TUESDAY:
            case WEDNESDAY:
            case THURSDAY:
            case FRIDAY:
                return "9am - 5pm";
            case SATURDAY:
                return "10am - 4pm"
            case SUNDAY:
                return "Closed.";
        }
    }
}
```

```java
var shop = new Shop();
shop.getOpeningHours(DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY);
// => "9am - 5pm"
```

## Adding methods and fields

Java programming language enum types are much more powerful than their counterparts in other languages.
The `enum` declaration defines a _class_ (called an _enum type_).
The enum class body can include methods and other fields:

```java
public enum Rating {
    GREAT(5),
    GOOD(4),
    OK(3),
    BAD(2),
    TERRIBLE(1);

    private final int numberOfStars;

    Rating(int numberOfStars) {
        this.numberOfStars = numberOfStars;
    }

    public int getNumberOfStars() {
        return this.numberOfStars;
    }
}
```

Calling the `getNumberOfStars` method on a member of the `Rating` enum type:

```java
Rating.GOOD.getNumberOfStars();
// => 4
```

## Built-in methods

The compiler automatically adds some special methods when it creates an enum.

For example, they have a static `values` method that returns an array containing all of the values of the enum in the order they are declared:

```java
for (DayOfWeek dayOfWeek : DayOfWeek.values()) {
    System.out.println(dayOfWeek.toString());
}
```

The snippet above would print the following:

```text
SUNDAY
MONDAY
TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY
THURSDAY
FRIDAY
SATURDAY
```

The compiler also adds a static `valueOf` method that returns an enum member based on its name:

```java
DayOfWeek.valueOf("SUNDAY");
// => DayOfWeek.SUNDAY
```
