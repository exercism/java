# Introduction

There are two different types of numbers in Java:

- Integers: numbers with no digits behind the decimal separator (whole numbers). Examples are `-6`, `0`, `1`, `25`, `976` and `-500000`.
- Floating-point numbers: numbers with zero or more digits behind the decimal separator. Examples are `-20.4`, `0.1`, `2.72`, `16.984025` and `1024.0`.

The two most common numeric types in Java are `int` and `double`. An `int` is a 32-bit integer and a `double` is a 64-bit floating-point number.

Arithmetic is done using the standard arithmetic operators. Numbers can be compared using the standard numeric comparison operators (eg. `5 > 4` and `4 <= 5`) and the equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) operators.

Java has two types of numeric conversions:

1. Implicit conversions: no data will be lost and no additional syntax is required.
2. Explicit conversions: data could be lost and additional syntax in the form of a _cast_ is required.

As an `int` has less precision than a `double`, converting from an `int` to a `double` is safe and is thus an implicit conversion. However, converting from a `double` to an `int` could mean losing data, so that requires an explicit conversion.

In this exercise you must conditionally execute logic. The most common way to do this in Java is by using an `if/else` statement:

```java
int x = 6;

if (x == 5) {
    // Execute logic if x equals 5
} else if (x > 7) {
    // Execute logic if x greater than 7
} else {
    // Execute logic in all other cases
}
```

The condition of an `if` statement must be of type `boolean`.
