# Introduction

Imagine you’re at an airport, watching suitcases glide past on a conveyor belt. 
You don’t grab every bag—you scan for yours, maybe sort by color or tag, and pick only what you need. 
That’s how Java Streams work.

Instead of writing loops and mutating variables, you describe *what* you want to do with the data. Want to filter out expensive items? Map names to uppercase? Count how many entries match a condition? Streams make it all feel natural.

Streams are part of Java’s functional programming toolkit. They help you write code that’s:
- **Declarative** – Focused on intent, not mechanics.
- **Composable** – Easy to chain operations.
- **Lazy** – Efficient by computing only when needed.

Once you start using streams, you’ll find yourself writing fewer loops and more elegant pipelines. It’s not just cleaner—it’s fun.
