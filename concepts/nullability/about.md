# About

In Java, the [`null` literal][null-keyword] is used to denote the absence of a value.

[Primitive variables][primitive-data-types] in java all have a default value and therefore can never be `null`.
By convention, they start with a lowercase letter e.g `int`

[Reference variables][reference-data-types] contain the memory address of an object and can have a value of null.
These variables usually start with an uppercase e.g `String`

Attempting to assign a primitive variable a value of `null` will result in a compile time error as the variable always holds
a default value of the type assigned.

```java
//Throws compile time error stating the required type is int, but null was provided
int number = null;
```

Assigning a reference variable a `null` value will not result in a compile time error as reference variables are nullable.

```java
//No error will occur as the String variable str is nullable
String str = null;
```

Whilst accessing a reference variable which has a value of `null` will compile fine, it will result in a `NullPointerException` being thrown at runtime.

```java
int[] arr = null;

// Throws NullPointerException at runtime
arr.Length;
```

A [`NullPointerException` is thrown][null-pointer-exception] when trying to access a reference variable which is null but requires an object.

To safely work with nullable values, one should check if they are `null` before working with them which can be done using [equality operators][equality-operators] such as `==` or `!=`:

```java
int[] arr = null;

if(arr != null) {
    System.out.println(arr.length);
} else {
    //Perform an alternate action when arr is null
}
```
