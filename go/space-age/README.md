# Space Age

Welcome to Space Age on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

- Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
- Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

If you're wondering why Pluto didn't make the cut, go watch [this

## Simple Stub

The space_age.go "stub file" contains only one line with the correct
package name and nothing more.  This will be the usual pattern for future
exercises.  You will need to figure out the function signature(s).

One way to figure out the function signature(s) is to look
at the corresponding \*\_test.go file. It will show the package level
functions(s) that the test will use to verify the solution.

## Planet Type

The test cases make use of a custom `Planet` type that is sent to your function.
You will need to implement this custom type yourself.
Implementing this new custom type as a string should suffice.
