Welcome to Sum Of Multiples on Exercism's Go Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.
