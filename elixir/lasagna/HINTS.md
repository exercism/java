# Hints

## General

- An [integer value][integers] can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.
- [String][string] literals are a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] without any arguments.
- You need to return an [integer][integers].

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single argument.
- You have to [implicitly return an integer][return] from a function.
- The function's argument is an [integer][integers].
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][operators] to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single argument.
- You have to [implicitly return an integer][return] from a function.
- The function's argument is an [integer][integers].
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplication][operators] to multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with two arguments.
- You have to [implicitly return an integer][return] from a function.
- The function's argument is an [integer][integers].
- You can invoke one of the other functions you've defined previously.
