## Java Track Tooling

Next to the exercises, the Java track also consists of the following tooling:

- [exercism/java-representer] - The Exercism [representer][docs-representers] for the Java track that creates normalized representations of submitted solutions.
- [exercism/java-analyzer] - The Exercism [analyzer][docs-analyzers] for the Java track that automatically provides comments on submitted solutions.
