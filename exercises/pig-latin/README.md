# Pig Latin

Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be
confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken
quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers)
to understand.

- **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to
  the end of the word.
- **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the
  end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.

There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional
variants too.

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin> for more details.


To run the tests:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
