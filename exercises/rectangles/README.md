# Rectangles

Count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```text
   +--+
  ++  |
+-++--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains 6 rectangles:

```text


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```text
       
       
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```text
       
       
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

```text
       
  ++   
  ++   
       
       
```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of
every line equals the length of the first line).
