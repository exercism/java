# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Java to install the necessary
dependencies:

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.
