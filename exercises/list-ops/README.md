# List Ops

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

## Hints

The `foldLeft` and `foldRight` methods are "fold" functions, which is a concept well-known in the functional programming world, but less so in the object-oriented one. See the Wikipedia page on folding for [general background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) and [signature/implementation hints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)#Linear_folds).



To run the tests:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
