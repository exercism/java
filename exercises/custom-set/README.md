# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Java to install the necessary
dependencies:

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
