# Running the Tests

Choose your operating system:

* [Windows](#windows)
* [macOS](#macos)
* [Linux](#linux)

# Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. Get the first exercise:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe>exercism download --exercise hello-world --track java

     Not Submitted:     1 problem
     java (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\java\hello-world

     New:               1 problem
     java (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\java\hello-world

     unchanged: 0, updated: 0, new: 1
   ```

3. Change directory into the exercism:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\java\hello-world
     ```
   
4. Run the tests:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe>gradle test
     ```
   *(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

5. Solve the exercise.  Find and work through the `instructions.append.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/java/blob/main/exercises/practice/hello-world/.docs/instructions.append.md#tutorial)).


Good luck!  Have fun!
