# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

# Bonus/Challenge

Once you get the string "Hello, World!" to work, try to add in more challenging code. 
1. Adding an if/else/else if statements 
    a. Have the user enter in a number between 0 to 10. If the value is between 0 and 5, return "Hello, Again!" (if statement)
