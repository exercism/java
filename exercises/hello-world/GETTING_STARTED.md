# Quick Start Guide

This guide picks-up where [Running the Tests (in Java)](http://exercism.io/languages/java/tests)
left off.  If you haven't reviewed those instructions, do so now.

Need more information?  A **step-by-step tutorial** is available in this directory at TUTORIAL.md or you can read 
the [HTML version](https://github.com/exercism/xjava/blob/master/exercises/hello-world/TUTORIAL.md).

The following instructions work equally well on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

## Solve "Hello World"

Try writing a solution that passes one test at a time, running Gradle each time:


```
$ gradle test
```

## Iterate through the tests

After your first test passes, remove the `@Ignore` from the next test, and iterate on your solution,
testing after each change.

## All the tests pass?  Submit your solution!

With a working solution that we've reviewed, we're ready to submit it to
exercism.io.

```
$ exercism submit src/main/java/HelloWorld.java
```

## Next Steps

From here, there are a number of paths you can take.

1. Move on to the next exercise
2. Review (and comment on) others' submissions to this exercise
3. Submit another iteration
4. Contribute to Exercism
