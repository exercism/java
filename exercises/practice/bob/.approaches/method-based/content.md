# Method-Based Approach

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
In this approach, the different conditions for Bob’s responses are separated into dedicated private methods within the `Bob` class. This method-based approach improves readability and modularity by organizing each condition check into its own method, making the main response method easier to understand and maintain.

The main `hey` method determines Bob’s response by delegating each condition to a helper method (`isSilent`, `isYelling`, and `isAsking`), each encapsulating specific logic.

## Explanation

This approach simplifies the main method `hey` by breaking down each response condition into helper methods:

1. **Trimming the Input**:
   The `input` is trimmed using the `String` [`trim()`][trim] method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. This helps to accurately detect if the input is empty and should prompt a `"Fine. Be that way!"` response.

2. **Delegating to Helper Methods**:
   Each condition is evaluated using the following helper methods:

   - **`isSilent`**: Checks if the trimmed input has no characters.
   - **`isYelling`**: Checks if the input is all uppercase and contains at least one alphabetic character, indicating shouting.
   - **`isAsking`**: Verifies if the trimmed input ends with a question mark.

   This modular approach keeps each condition encapsulated, enhancing code clarity.

3. **Order of Checks**:
   The order of checks within `hey` is important:
   - Silence is evaluated first, as it requires an immediate response.
   - Shouted questions take precedence over individual checks for yelling and asking.
   - Yelling comes next, requiring its response if not combined with a question.
   - Asking (a non-shouted question) is checked afterward.

   This ordering ensures that Bob’s response matches the expected behavior without redundancy.

```java
class Bob {
    String hey(String input) {
        var inputTrimmed = input.trim();
        
        if (isSilent(inputTrimmed))
           return "Fine. Be that way!";
        if (isYelling(inputTrimmed) && isAsking(inputTrimmed))
            return "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!";
        if (isYelling(inputTrimmed))
            return "Whoa, chill out!";
        if (isAsking(inputTrimmed))
            return "Sure.";
            
        return "Whatever.";
    }

    private boolean isYelling(String input) {
        return input.chars()
                    .anyMatch(Character::isLetter) &&
                input.chars()
                    .filter(Character::isLetter)
                    .allMatch(Character::isUpperCase);
    }

    private boolean isAsking(String input) {
        return input.endsWith("?");
    }

    private boolean isSilent(String input) {
        return input.length() == 0;
    }
}
```

## Shortening

When the body of an `if` statement is a single line, both the test expression and the body _could_ be put on the same line, like so:

```java
if (isSilent(inputTrimmed)) return "Fine. Be that way!";
```

or the body _could_ be put on a separate line without curly braces:

```java
if (isSilent(inputTrimmed))
    return "Fine. Be that way!";
```

However, the [Java Coding Conventions][coding-conventions] advise always using curly braces for `if` statements, which helps to avoid errors. Your team may choose to overrule them at its own risk.

## Advantages of the Method-Based Approach

- **Readability**: Each method is clearly responsible for a specific condition, making the main response logic easy to follow.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to a condition can be confined to its method, minimizing impacts on the rest of the code.
- **Code Reusability**: Helper methods can be reused or adapted easily if new conditions are added in the future.

## Considerations

- **Efficiency**: While this approach introduces multiple method calls, it enhances readability significantly, which is often more valuable in non-performance-critical applications.
- **Error Prevention**: This approach avoids redundant code, reducing the risk of maintenance errors.

## Shortening Condition Checks

If each `if` statement body is only a single line, braces can be omitted, or the test expression and result could be placed on a single line. However, [Java Coding Conventions][coding-conventions] recommend always using curly braces for error prevention and easier future modifications.

### Alternative: Inline Helper Methods

For smaller projects, consider implementing helper methods inline or as lambdas, though this might reduce readability.
