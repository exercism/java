# Instructions

In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.
The program will take 1, 4, or 5 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.
The color bands are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

In `resistor-color trio` you decoded the first three colors.
For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value `330`.
In this exercise you will need to add _tolerance_ to the mix.
Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value.
For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.

The tolerance band will have one of these values:

- Grey - 0.05%
- Violet - 0.1%
- Blue - 0.25%
- Green - 0.5%
- Brown - 1%
- Red - 2%
- Gold - 5%
- Silver - 10%

The four-band resistor is built up like this:

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3     | band_4    |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-brown-green would be 330 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-orange-red-grey would be 3300 ohms with ±0.05% tolerance.

The difference between a four and five-band resistor is that the five-band resistor has an extra band to indicate a more precise value.

| Band_1  | Band_2  | Band_3  | Band_4     | band_5    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Value_1 | Value_2 | Value_3 | Multiplier | Tolerance |

Meaning

- orange-orange-orange-black-green would be 333 ohms with a ±0.5% tolerance.
- orange-red-orange-blue-violet would be 323M ohms with a ±0.10 tolerance.

There are also one band resistors.
One band resistors only have the color black with a value of 0.

This exercise is about translating the resistor band colors into a label:

"... ohms ...%"

So an input of "orange", "orange", "black", "green" should return:

"33 ohms ±0.5%"

When there are more than a thousand ohms, we say "kiloohms".
 That's similar to saying "kilometer" for 1000 meters, and "kilograms" for 1000 grams.

So an input of "orange", "orange", "orange", "grey" should return:

"33 kiloohms ±0.05%"

When there are more than a million ohms, we say "megaohms".

So an input of "orange", "orange", "blue", "red" should return:

"33 megaohms ±2%"
