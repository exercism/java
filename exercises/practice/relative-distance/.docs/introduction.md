# Introduction

You've been hired to develop **Noble Knots**, the hottest new dating app for nobility!
With centuries of royal intermarriage, things have gottenâ€¦ _complicated_.
To avoid any _oops-we're-twins_ situations, your job is to build a system that checks how closely two people are related.

Noble Knots is inspired by Iceland's "[Islendinga-App][islendiga-app]," which is backed up by a database that traces all known family connections between Icelanders from the time of the settlement of Iceland.
Your algorithm will determine the **degree of separation** between two individuals in the royal family tree.

Will your app help crown a perfect match?
