# Introduction

There ae at least a couple general ways to solve ISBN Verifier.
One approach is to scrub and validate the input first.
A variation of that approach could then use [`map()`][map] and [`sum()`][sum] to iterate to the result.
Another approach is to validate as you go.
One way to do that is in a [`for-each`][for-each] loop to iterate to the result.
Another way could use [`chars()`][chars] and [`forEach()`][foreach] to iterate to the result.

## General guidance

One important aspect to solving ISBN is to process the characters as digits according to their position, while disregarding dashes,
and paying special attention that an `X` character is only a legal value of `10` if it is in the last legal digit position.
Another important aspect is that the number of digit positions must be ten.

## Approaches: `map()` with `sum()`

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

class IsbnVerifier {

    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        String scrubbed = s.replace("-", "");

        return scrubbed.matches("^([0-9]{10}|[0-9]{9}X)$") &&
            IntStream.range(0, scrubbed.length())
            .map(pos -> {
                var chr = scrubbed.charAt(pos);
                return (chr != 'X' ? chr - '0' : 10) * (10 - pos);
            })
            .sum() % 11 == 0;
    }
}
```

## Approach `for-each` loop

```java
class IsbnVerifier {

    boolean isValid(String stringToVerify) {
        int sum = 0;
        int pos = 0;
        
        for (var chr: stringToVerify.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isDigit(chr)) {
                sum += (chr - '0') * (10 - pos);
                pos++;
                continue;
            }
            if (chr == '-')
                continue;
            if (chr == 'X' && pos == 9) {
                sum += 10;
                pos++;
                continue;
            }
            return false;
        }
        
        return pos == 10 && sum % 11 == 0;
    }

}
```

## Approach: `chars()` with `forEach()`

```java
class IsbnVerifier {

    boolean isValid(String stringToVerify) {
        var acc = new IsbnAcc();
        stringToVerify.chars().forEach(acc::calc);
        return acc.isIsbn();
    }

}

class IsbnAcc {
    int sum = 0;
    int pos = 0;
    boolean allValidChars = true;

    boolean isIsbn() {
        return allValidChars && pos == 10 && sum % 11 == 0;
    }

    void calc(int codePoint) {
        if (Character.isDigit(codePoint)) {
            sum += (codePoint - '0') * (10 - pos);
            pos++;
            return;
        }
        if (codePoint == '-')
            return;
        if (codePoint == 'X' && pos == 9) {
            sum += 10;
            pos++;
            return;
        }
        allValidChars = false;
    }
}
```

## Which approach to use?

Since benchmarking with the [Java Microbenchmark Harness][jmh] is currently outside the scope of this document,
the choice between the approaches can be made by perceived readability.

It might be thought that iterating to [`replace()`][replace] dash characters and then iterating again to check
a [regular expression pattern][pattern] might be less efficient than validating as you go,
but the string to be iterated is so short that it may not matter much.

An advantage to the `for-each` loop approach is that the function can return `false` immediately upon encountering an illegal character.

An advantage  to the `chars()` with `forEach()` approach is that the validation/accumulating is encapsulated somewhere else,
making the `isValid()` method's implementation itself quite simple.
