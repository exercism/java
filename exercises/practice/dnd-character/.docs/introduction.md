# Introduction

You are a member of a party of the famous game [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd] and you are about to embark on a new fantasy.
Each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.
These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.
You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice.
You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier.
You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.
