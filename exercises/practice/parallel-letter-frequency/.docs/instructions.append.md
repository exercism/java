The automated tests are currently not checking for parallelism. Please ensure yourself that your solution is using some form of parallelism, like threads or parallel streams.

The following resources may help you with this:

- [Concurrency (Oracle Java Tutorials)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency)
- [Java Concurrency (Baeldung)](https://www.baeldung.com/java-concurrency)
- [Java 8 Parallel Streams (Baeldung)](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-streams#parallel-streams)

As a stretch goal, consider if your implementation will work for characters with [diacritics or accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic). For example, such solutions should not consider e and Ã« the same character. An example text for this case is [Wilhelmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelmus), the Dutch national anthem.
