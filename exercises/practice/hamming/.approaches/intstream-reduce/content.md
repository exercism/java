# `IntStream` with `reduce()`

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Hamming {

    final private int difference;

    public Hamming(String leftStrand, String rightStrand) {
        if (leftStrand.isEmpty() && !rightStrand.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("left strand must not be empty.");
        }
        if (rightStrand.isEmpty() && !leftStrand.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("right strand must not be empty.");
        }
        if (leftStrand.length() != rightStrand.length()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("leftStrand and rightStrand must be of equal length.");
        }
        difference = IntStream.range(0, leftStrand.length()).reduce(0,
            (hamcount, index) -> hamcount + (leftStrand.charAt(index) != rightStrand.charAt(index) ? 1 : 0));
    }

    public int getHammingDistance() {
        return difference;
    }
}
```

This approach starts by importing `java.util.stream.IntStream`.
It then defines a [`private`][private] [`final`][final] `long` variable to keep track of the difference between the strands.

After the validation code, the real work is done by the [`IntStream`][intstream].
It uses its [`range()`][range] method to iterate from `0` up to but not including the length of the left strand.
Each number is passed into the [`reduce()`][reduce] method, whose accumulator is initialized to `0`.
For each value of `index`,
the [lambda][lambda] function inside the `reduce()` method compares the values of the elements in the two strands at the index of `index`.
Using a [ternary operator][ternary], the `reduce()` method adds `1` to the accumulator for only those indexes whose elements differ between the two strands.
Otherwise it adds `0`.
The difference variable is set to the value returned from the `reduce()` method, which is the value of its accumulator.

The `getHammingDistance()` method returns the difference variable, which is set to the correct value after the `IntStream` is done.
