# Hints

This is the first exercise with tests that require you to throw an [`Exception`][exception-docs].
`Exception`s are typically thrown to indicate that a program has encountered an unexpected input or state.

Tests throughout the track will verify that the exceptions you throw are:

1. instances of a specified Java type;
2. (optionally) initialized with a specified message.
