# Queen Attack Approach

```java
class QueenAttackCalculator {
    private final Queen queen1;
    private final Queen queen2;
    
    QueenAttackCalculator(Queen queen1, Queen queen2) {
        if (queen1 == null || queen2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("You must supply valid positions for both Queens.");
        }
        if (queen1.getRow() == queen2.getRow() && queen1.getColumn() == queen2.getColumn()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Queens cannot occupy the same position.");
        }
        this.queen1 = queen1;
        this.queen2 = queen2;
    }

    boolean canQueensAttackOneAnother() {
        int rowDifference = Math.abs(queen1.getRow() - queen2.getRow());
        int columnDifference = Math.abs(queen1.getColumn() - queen2.getColumn());
        return rowDifference == 0 || columnDifference == 0 || rowDifference == columnDifference;
    }
}
```

## Approach Steps

1. **Check if Queens are on the Same Row**:
   - If both queens are on the same row, they can attack each other. This is checked by comparing their row values:

     ```java
     if (queen1.getRow() == queen2.getRow()) {
         return true;
     }
     ```

2. **Check if Queens are on the Same Column**:
   - If both queens are on the same column, they can attack each other. This is checked by comparing their column values:

     ```java
     if (queen1.getColumn() == queen2.getColumn()) {
         return true;
     }
     ```

3. **Check if Queens are on the Same Diagonal**:
   - If both queens are on the same diagonal, they can attack each other. This is checked by comparing the absolute difference between their row and column values:

     ```java
     if (Math.abs(queen1.getRow() - queen2.getRow()) == Math.abs(queen1.getColumn() - queen2.getColumn())) {
         return true;
     }
     ```

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If any of the above checks return `true`, the queens can attack each other. Otherwise, they cannot.

## Explanation

- **Row Check**: We first check if the queens are in the same row. If they are, they can attack each other.
- **Column Check**: Next, we check if the queens are in the same column. If they are, they can attack each other.
- **Diagonal Check**: Lastly, we check if the queens are positioned on the same diagonal. This is determined by comparing the absolute differences in their row and column positions.
- **Final Decision**: If any of these checks return `true`, the queens can attack each other. If none of these conditions are met, they cannot attack each other.

## Additional Explanation for Code

1. **Constructor**:

   In the constructor of `QueenAttackCalculator`, we check if the queens are positioned at valid places.
   If either queen is `null`, or if both queens occupy the same position, an exception is thrown.
   The constructor takes two `Queen` objects, `queen1` and `queen2`, and stores them as instance variables.

2. **Method (`canQueensAttackOneAnother`)**:

    - This method computes the row and column differences between the two queens and then checks:
    - If the row difference is zero (queens are on the same row).
    - If the column difference is zero (queens are on the same column).
    - If the row and column differences are equal (queens are on the same diagonal).
    - If any of these checks are true, the method returns `true`, indicating that the queens can attack each other.
