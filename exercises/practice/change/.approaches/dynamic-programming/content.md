# Dynamic Programming Approach

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class ChangeCalculator {
    private final List<Integer> currencyCoins;

    ChangeCalculator(List<Integer> currencyCoins) {
        this.currencyCoins = currencyCoins;
    }

    List<Integer> computeMostEfficientChange(int grandTotal) {
        if (grandTotal < 0) 
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative totals are not allowed.");

        List<List<Integer>> coinsUsed = new ArrayList<>(grandTotal + 1);
        coinsUsed.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());

        for (int i = 1; i <= grandTotal; i++) {
            List<Integer> bestCombination = null;
            for (int coin: currencyCoins) {
                if (coin <= i && coinsUsed.get(i - coin) != null) {
                    List<Integer> currentCombination = new ArrayList<>(coinsUsed.get(i - coin));
                    currentCombination.add(0, coin);
                    if (bestCombination == null || currentCombination.size() < bestCombination.size())
                        bestCombination = currentCombination;
                }
            }
            coinsUsed.add(bestCombination);
        }

        if (coinsUsed.get(grandTotal) == null)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The total " + grandTotal + " cannot be represented in the given currency.");

        return coinsUsed.get(grandTotal);
    }
}
```

The **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach is an efficient way to solve the problem of making change for a given total using a list of available coin denominations.
It minimizes the number of coins needed by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them progressively.

This approach ensures that we find the most efficient way to make change and handles edge cases where no solution exists.

## Explanation

1. **Initialize Coins Usage Tracker**:

   - We create a list `coinsUsed`, where each index `i` stores the most efficient combination of coins that sum up to the value `i`.
   - The list is initialized with an empty list at index `0`, as no coins are needed to achieve a total of zero.

2. **Iterative Dynamic Programming**:

   - For each value `i` from 1 to `grandTotal`, we explore all available coin denominations to find the best combination that can achieve the total `i`.
   - For each coin, we check if it can be part of the solution (i.e., if `coin <= i` and `coinsUsed[i - coin]` is a valid combination).
   - If so, we generate a new combination by adding the current coin to the solution for `i - coin`. We then compare the size of this new combination with the existing best combination and keep the one with fewer coins.

3. **Result**:

   - After processing all values up to `grandTotal`, the combination at `coinsUsed[grandTotal]` will represent the most efficient solution.
   - If no valid combination exists for `grandTotal`, an exception is thrown.

## Key Points

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the `grandTotal` and `m` is the number of available coin denominations. This is because we iterate over all coin denominations for each amount up to `grandTotal`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the list `coinsUsed`, which stores the most efficient coin combination for each total up to `grandTotal`.

- **Edge Cases**:

  - If the `grandTotal` is negative, an exception is thrown immediately.
  - If there is no way to make the exact total with the given denominations, an exception is thrown with a descriptive message.

## Conclusion

The dynamic programming approach provides an optimal solution for the change-making problem, ensuring that we minimize the number of coins used while efficiently solving the problem for any `grandTotal`.
However, itâ€™s essential to consider the trade-offs in terms of memory usage and the time complexity when dealing with very large inputs.
