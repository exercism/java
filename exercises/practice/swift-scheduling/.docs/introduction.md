# Introduction

This week, it is your turn to take notes in the department's planning meeting.
In this meeting, your boss will set delivery dates for all open work items.
Annoyingly, instead of specifying the _actual_ delivery dates, your boss will only _describe them_ in an abbreviated format.
As many of your colleagues won't be familiar with this corporate lingo, you'll need to convert these delivery date descriptions to actual delivery dates.
