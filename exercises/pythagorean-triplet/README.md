# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```text
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.
