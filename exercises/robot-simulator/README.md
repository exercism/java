# Robot Simulator

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular
direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the
testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which
direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream
  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Java to install the necessary
dependencies:

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
