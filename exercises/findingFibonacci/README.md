#Finding Fibonacci Number

Implement the finding Fibonacci number algorithm, which with the given list of numbers, the operation should return the list of fibonacci numbers that is on the input positions.

Given the number:
1, 2, 18

The output should be: 1, 1, 1584

## Restrictions

Solve the problem using only basic function, no external library!

For clear understanding, we take the first number in the fibonacci sequence would be 1 (so the fibonacci number in the first position is 1).
