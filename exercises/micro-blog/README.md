# Micro Blog

You have identified a gap in the social media market for very very short
posts. Now that Twitter allows 280 character posts, people wanting quick
social media updates aren't being served. You decide to create your own
social media network.

To make your product noteworthy, you make it extreme and only allow posts
of 5 or less characters. Any posts of more than 5 characters should be
truncated to 5.

To allow your users to express themselves fully, you allow Emoji and
other Unicode.

The task is to truncate input strings to 5 characters.

## Text Encodings

Text stored digitally has to be converted to a series of bytes.
There are 3 ways to map characters to bytes in common use.
* **ASCII** can encode English language characters. All
characters are precisely 1 byte long.
* **UTF-8** is a Unicode text encoding. Characters take between 1
and 4 bytes.
* **UTF-16** is a Unicode text encoding. Characters are either 2 or
4 bytes long.

UTF-8 and UTF-16 are both Unicode encodings which means they're capable of
representing a massive range of characters including:
* Text in most of the world's languages and scripts
* Historic text
* Emoji

UTF-8 and UTF-16 are both variable length encodings, which means that
different characters take up different amounts of space.

Consider the letter 'a' and the emoji 'ðŸ˜›'. In UTF-16 the letter takes
2 bytes but the emoji takes 4 bytes.

The trick to this exercise is to use APIs designed around Unicode
characters (codepoints) instead of Unicode codeunits.

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
