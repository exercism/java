This exercise requires you to handle exceptions. An [exception](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/definition.html) is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

In Java, there are two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked exceptions.

Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.

Unchecked exceptions are the exceptions that are not checked at compiled time.
