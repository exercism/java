# Spiral Matrix

Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.

The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1
in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order,
like these examples:

###### Spiral matrix of size 3

```text
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

###### Spiral matrix of size 4

```text
 1  2  3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10  9  8 7
```

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.
