# Spiral Matrix

Given the size, return a square matrix of numbers in spiral order.

The matrix should be filled with natural numbers, starting from 1
in the top-left corner, increasing in an inward, clockwise spiral order,
like these examples:

###### Spiral matrix of size 3

```plain
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

###### Spiral matrix of size 4

```plain
 1  2  3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10  9  8 7
```


To run the tests:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
