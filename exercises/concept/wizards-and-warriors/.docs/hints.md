# Hints

## General

Detailed explanation of inheritance can be found at [Inheritance][inheritance-main].
The whole inheritance concept has a lot to do with the concepts around [overriding][java-overriding].

## 1. Describe a Fighter.

- In Java, the `toString()` method is actually present inside the Object class (which is a superclass to all the classes in Java).
  You can read more about it [here][object-class-java].

- To override this method inside your implementation class, you should have a method with same name i.e `toString()` and same return type
  i.e `String`.

## 2. Making Fighters not vulnerable by default.

- Consider having a method `isVulnerable()` inside the `Fighter` class which states vulnerability of the fighter, return `false` to make it non-vulnerable by default.
- This can than be overridden by any child class(the class extending `Fighter`), according to its requirements.

- Again the [overriding][java-overriding] concept will come handy.

## 3. Allowing wizards to prepare a spell.

- Preparing a spell can only be done by a wizard. So, it makes sense to have this property defined inside the `Wizard` class.

- Create `prepareSpell()` method inside `Wizard` class.

- Remember : Parent class(here `Fighter`) has no access to the properties of the child class(for example, `Wizard`)

## 4. Make Wizards vulnerable when not having prepared a spell

- Override the `isVulnerable()` method in the `Wizard` class to make Wizards vulnerable if they haven't prepared a spell.

## 5. Calculate the damage points for a Wizard

- Use a [conditional statement][if-else] to return the damage points, taking into account the value of the prepare spell field.

## 6. Calculate the damage points for a Warrior

- Use a [conditional statement][if-else] to return the the damage points, taking into account the vulnerability of the target.
