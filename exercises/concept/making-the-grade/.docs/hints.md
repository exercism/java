# Hints

## 1. Non-Passing Students

- Try using one of the loops that is iteration centric.

## 2. Get the average grade of students

- Try using one of the loops that is condition centric using numberOfStudents as one of the core conditions.

## 3. Calculating letter grades

- Remember that there is a condition centric loop that guarantees the body to be executed at least once.

## 4. Matching Names to Scores

- Try using a iteration centric loop that allow you to work with indexes.
