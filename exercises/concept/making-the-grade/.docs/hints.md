## 2. Get the average grade of students

## 3. Calculating letter grades

- Remember that there is a condition centric loop that guarantees the body to be executed at least once.

## 4. Matching Names to Scores

- Try using a iteration centric loop that allow you to work with indexes.

## 5. Count Odd Scores

- Remember that you could use the modulus operator `%` to check if a division has a certain reminder.
- Try using a iteration centric loop
- Check the statements/keywords covered in the concept an use one of them.

## 6. Challenging Exam

- Try using a iteration centric loop
- Check the statements/keywords covered in the concept an use one of them.
