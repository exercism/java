# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll be implementing rules for calculating the total salary of a employee in a month.
The International Siderurgy Company (ISC) requires assistance in calculating employee salaries, considering various factors that can impact the final wage.

You have three tasks, and you should use the ternary operator instead of if/else statements to implement them.

## 1. Determine the salary multiplier

Implement the `salaryMultiplier` method, which returns the salary multiplier based on the number of days an employee skipped work.
Apply a 15% penalty if the employee skipped at least five days.

```java
int daysSkipped = 3;
salaryMultiplier(daysSkipped);
// => 1.0

daysSkipped = 7;
salaryMultiplier(daysSkipped);
// => 0.85
```

## 2. Calculate the bonus for products sold

Implement the `bonusMultiplier` and `bonusForProductsSold` methods.
The ISC pays ten monetary units for each product sold, and if an employee sells twenty products or more, the multiplier improves to thirteen.
`bonusMultiplier` should determine which multiplier to apply, and `bonusForProductSold` should return the total bonus in monetary units.

```java
int productsSold = 21;
bonusMultiplier(productsSold);
// => 13
bonusForProductsSold(productsSold);
// => 273

productsSold = 5;
bonusMultiplier(productsSold);
// => 10
bonusForProductsSold(productsSold);
// => 50
```

## 3. Calculate the final salary for the employee

Implement the `finalSalary` method.
It should multiply the base salary of `1000.00` by the salary multiplier, add the bonus, and return the result.
However, salaries should be capped at `2000.00`.

```java
int daysSkipped = 2;
int productsSold = 3;
finalSalary(daysSkipped, productsSold);
// => 1030.00

productsSold = 90;
finalSalary(daysSkipped, productsSold);
// => 2000.00
```
