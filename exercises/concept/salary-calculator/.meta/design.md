# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to use ternary expressions - using the `?:` operator.

## Out of scope

- Nothing notable

## Concepts

- `ternary-operators`: how to use the ternary operator to do conditional logic

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers`: double and int types
- `conditionals-if` : use `if else` expressions

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `essential`: If the student did not use `ternary operators` on `salaryMultiplier`, `bonusMultiplier` or `finalSalary` methods, instruct them to do so.
- `actionable`: If the student did not reuse the implementation of the `bonusMultiplier` method in the `bonusForProductsSold` method, instruct them to do so.
- `actionable`: If the student did not reuse the implementation of the `salaryMultiplier` or `bonusForProductsSold` methods in the `finalSalary` method, instruct them to do so.

If the solution does not receive any of the above feedback, it must be exemplar.
