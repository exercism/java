# Hints

## 1. Generate a random planet

- Java does not provide a function to choose an element from a collection at random.
- Remember that you can retrieve an element from an array by its index, which is an integer.

## 2. Generate a random starship registry number

- The `java.util.Random` class provides a method to generate a random `int` between 0 and a given maximum.

## 3. Generate a random stardate

- The `java.util.Random` class method to generate a random `double` always returns a number between `0.0` and `1.0`.
