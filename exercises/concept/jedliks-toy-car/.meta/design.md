# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what classes are.
- Know what encapsulation is.
- Know what fields are.
- Know how to create an object.
- Know how to update state through methods.
- Know about the `void` type.

## Out of scope

- Reference equality.
- Constructors.
- Interfaces.
- Inheritance.
- Finalizers.
- Method overloading.

## Concepts

- `classes`: know what classes are; know what encapsulation is; know what fields are; know how to create an object; know how to update state through methods; know about the `void` type.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know how to define a basic class with basic methods.
- `strings`: know how to do basic string interpolation.
- `numbers`: know how to compare numbers.
- `conditionals`: know how to do conditional logic.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `essential`: Verify that the solution keeps the void type for the drive function.
- `essential`: Verify that the solution has fields in the class
- `actionable`: If the solution defines the fields as `public`, instruct the student to use `private` and explain the encapsulation principle.
- `informative`: If the solution does not use a primitive as a type for the fields, inform the student to use it.
   Explain that the values cannot be null and it is less error-prone
