# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about bitwise operations in Java.

## Learning objectives

- Learn about the bitwise operators `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `&`, `|`, `^` and `~`

## Concepts

- `bit-manipulation`: Know of the bit operators `>>`, `<<`, `>>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- 'numbers'

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `essential`: If the student did not use the `>>>` operator in the `shiftBack` method, instruct the student to do so.
- `essential`: If the student did not use the `|` operator in the `setBits` method, instruct the student to do so.
- `essential`: If the student did not use the `^` operator in the `flipBits` method, instruct the student to do so.
- `essential`: If the student did not use the `&` operator in the `clearBits` method, instruct the student to do so.
- `informative`: If the solution did not use the `~` operator in the `clearBits` method, inform the student that with it will achieve a more concise solution.

If the solution does not receive any of the above feedback, it must be exemplar.
Leave a `celebratory` comment to celebrate the success!
