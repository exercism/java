# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `boolean` type and its two values.
- Know about boolean operators and how to build logical expressions with them.
- Know of the boolean operator precedence rules.

## Out of scope

Nothing to report

## Concepts

- `booleans`: know of the existence of the `boolean` type and its two values; know about boolean operators and how to build logical expressions with them; know of the boolean operator precedence rules.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know how to define methods.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `actionable`: If the student used an `if` statement to return `true` or `false` in their solution, suggest to them the `if` is unnecessary.
- `actionable`: If the student compares a boolean variable with `true` or `false` (e.g. `knightIsAwake == true` or `archerIsAwake == false`), suggest to them the comparison is unnecessary.

If the solution does not receive any of the above feedback, it must be exemplar.
