# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `char` type.
- Know what a char represents (a Unicode character).
- Know how to define a `char`.
- Know that a `char` is not the same as a single character string
- Know how to access a `char` in a string by index.
- Know of some basic `char` methods (like converting to uppercase).
- Know that `char`s are immutable.
- Know how to compare characters.
- Know how to use a `StringBuilder`.

## Out of scope

- Converting an integer to a character and vice versa.
- Advanced unicode issues such as surrogates, text normalization, combining characters.
- Cultural considerations and invariants.

## Concepts

- `chars`: know of the existence of the `char` type; know that a `char` represents; know how to define a `char`; know how to access a `char` in a string by index; know of some basic `char` methods (like converting to uppercase).
- `StringBuilder`: know how to use this.

## Prerequisites

- `strings`: know of the `string` type that will be iterated over and accessed by index.
- `for-loop` for loops (rather than foreach) are the best means of highlighting the relationship between strings and `char`s
