# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know about the `Map` interface.
- Know about `HashMap`.
- Know how to put, remove and retrieve items from a `Map`.
- Know how to find the keys of the map.

## Out of scope

- Map equality.
- The importance of the key object's `hashCode` and `equals` implementation and how `HashMap` uses them.
- More advanced or specific types of `Map`, such as `WeakHashMap` or `TreeMap`.
- Handling concurrency.

## Concepts

- `map`

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `classes`
- `foreach-loops`
- `generic-types`

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `actionable`: If the user directly returns the class field, recommend returning a copy to the student.

If the solution does not receive any of the above feedback, it must be exemplar.
Leave a `celebratory` comment to celebrate the success!
