# Hints

## General

- A [map][maps] is an associative data structure of key-value pairs.

## 1. Define a new high score map

- It should return an empty [map][maps].
- [Map module][map-module] functions or literal forms can be useful.

## 2. Add players to the high score map

- The resulting map should be returned.
- [Map module][map-module] contains functions useful for manipulating maps. [One of them][map-put] puts a value in a map under a given key.

## 3. Remove players from the score map

- The resulting map should be returned.
- [Map module][map-module] contains functions useful for manipulating maps. [One of them][map-delete] deletes a key from a map.

## 4. Reset a player's score

- The resulting map should be returned with the player's score reset to an initial value of 0.
- [Map module][map-module] contains functions useful for manipulating maps. [One of them][map-put] puts a value in a map under a given key.

## 5. Update a player's score

- The resulting map should be returned with the player's updated score.
- [Map module][map-module] contains functions useful for manipulating maps. [One of them][map-update] updates a value in a map under a given key.

## 6. Get a list of players

- [Map module][map-module] contains functions useful for manipulating maps. [One of them][map-keys] returns a list of all keys in a map.
