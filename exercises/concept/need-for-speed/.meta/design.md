# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what constructors are.
- Know how to create a constructor.
- Know how to initialize a new instance of a class.
- Know how to differentiate them with normal methods.

## Out of scope

- Method overloading.
- No arguments constructor.

## Concepts

- `constructors`: Know how to create `constructors` and what they are.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know how to define a basic class with basic methods.
- `conditionals`: know how to do conditional logic.
- `classes`: know how classes work.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer]:

- `actionable`: If the student used a loop in the `tryFinishTrack()` method, encourage it to explore a different approach.
- `actionable`: If the student used a conditional statement like `if/else` or ternary expressions in the `batteryDrained` method, encourage it to explore a different approach.

If the solution does not receive any of the above feedback, it must be exemplar.
