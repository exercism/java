# Introduction

A `String` in Java is an object that represents immutable text as a sequence of Unicode characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.). Double quotes are used to define a `String` instance:

```java
String fruit = "Apple";
```

Strings are manipulated by calling the string's methods. Once a string has been constructed, its value can never change. Any methods that appear to modify a string will actually return a new string.
The `String` class provides some _static_ methods to transform the strings.
