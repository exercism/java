# Hints

## 1. Get an employee by ID

- This method returns an `Optional<Employee>` object, not an `Employee` one.

## 2. Return the name and department of a given employee in a certain format

- You can call the method `getEmployeeById(int)` to get the employee.
- Remember the syntax of the `ifPresentOrElse()` method.
