# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

dependencies:

# Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal:

```sh
$ gradle test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore("Remove to run test")` annotation.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
