# Installing Java

In addition to the Exercism CLI and your favorite text editor,
practicing with Exercism exercises in Java requires the **Java Development Kit** (JDK).
The JDK includes both a Java Runtime _and_ development tools (most notably, the Java compiler).

There are many flavors of the JDK nowadays, some of which are open-source.
Here at Exercism we recommend using [Eclipse Temurin by Adoptium][adoptium].

## Supported Java versions

Exercism's Java track supports Java 21 LTS and earlier.

## Installing Eclipse Temurin

To install Eclipse Temurin on your system, head on over to their excellent [installation instructions][adoptium-installation-guide].
Here you will find instructions on how to install the JDK using your favorite package manager,
and it also contains links to downloadable installers for all major operating systems.

## Java IDEs

There are many free IDEs available for Java.
Here are some popular choices:

- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition][intellij-idea]
- [Eclipse][eclipse]
- [Visual Studio Code with the Java extension][vscode-java]
