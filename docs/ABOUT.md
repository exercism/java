[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose computer programming language that is 
- concurrent, 
- [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming), 
- [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), 

and specifically designed to have as few [implementation dependencies](http://www.java-tips.org/other-api-tips-100035/60-netbeans/1025-what-is-an-implementation-dependency-and-whathowwhen-should-i-use-one.html) as possible. Java applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:

 - It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
 - It must be robust and secure.
- It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
- It must execute with high performance.
- It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

Why Learn JAVA?

- JAVA IS EVERYWHERE. It is one of the most in-demand programming languages, a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android operating system. 

- Java is Platform Independent: This because of its [Write Once, Run Anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere)  policy.This is still one of the reasons for Java being a relatively better programming language. Most of the Java applications are developed in Windows environment and run on UNIX platform.
- Java has a Rich API:
Java provides [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)(Application Programming Interface) for I/O, networking, utilities, XML parsing, database connection, and almost everything. Whatever left is covered by open source libraries like Apache Commons, Google Guava and others.

- Standardization:
If you need to write a web/enterprise app, or you need data persistence or you need to do cryptography, no problem! Java is all you require.There are several other standardized stuff in the Java ecosystem, thanks to the [JCP](https://www.jcp.org/en/introduction/overview) (Java Community Process)!
