[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose computer programming language that is: 
 1. [Concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing) 
 2. [Class-Based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming)
 3. [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

Java applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

The primary goals kept in mind during the making of the language were:

 - It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
 - It must be robust and secure.
 - It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
 - It must execute with high performance.
 - It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

## Why Learn Java?

- JAVA IS EVERYWHERE. 
It is one of the most sought after programming languages.
It is a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the [Android operating system](https://developer.android.com/index.html). 

- [Write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) policy: Programs written in Java are compiled into machine-independent bytecodes, so it can run on any Java platform.
Basically, Java is [Platform Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform#Platform-independent_software)

- Java has rich APIs:
Java has built-in [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (APIs) for I/O, networking, data structures, concurrency, and many other functions.
Standard libraries can be supplemented by open source libraries like Apache Commons, Google Guava, Netty and others.

- Standardization:
If you need to write a web/enterprise app, or you need data persistence or you need to do cryptography, no problem!
Java is all you require.
There are many standard tools/practices that extend the Java ecosystem, thanks to the [Java Community Process](https://www.jcp.org/en/introduction/overview) (JCP)!
