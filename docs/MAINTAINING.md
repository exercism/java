## Your Permissions 

As a maintainer, you have write access to four repositories.  "write access" means you can: review, reject, accept and merge PRs; and push changes to these repos.  Despite having permissions to push directly, we tend to seek review of even our own PRs.

### Track-specific

- [xjava](https://github.com/exercism/xjava) — yeah... you know what this one is. :)

### Exercism-wide

- [x-common](https://github.com/exercism/x-common) — the library of canonical exercises.
- [discussions](https://github.com/exercism/discussions) — the place where project-wide conversations happen. 
  [issues sorted by most recently updated.](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- [todo](https://github.com/exercism/todo) — not really used... might just go away completely in the future.

## The Project Board

GitHub issues are great, but there's no way to easily set priorities.
To do this, we're using a GitHub Project: https://github.com/exercism/xjava/projects/2.

- **Epics** — issues that really represent bigger ideas.  These inspire creating a set of smaller issues to be elaborated...
- **Icebox** — issues that just needs a little more detail to be "ready to play"...
- **Backlog** — issues ready to be worked.  When we start working on an issue, we move it to the next column...
- **Current** — issues in progress.  When we've considered it done, we move the card to...
- **Delivered** — completed issues that could use another pair of eyes.  When these are reviewed they get moved to...
- **Done** — issues we've complete.  Every so often, we get together and it's nice to review what we've completed. 
  Once reviewed, we remove them from this Project.

The point of this board is to make clear our shared priorities.  It's a tool you can use.
However, if you have an idea and want to implement it, you can just do it; it does not have to be added to this board.

## Miscellaneous

- Issues marked with "policy" are current "team agreements": [exercism?label:policy](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aexercism+label%3Apolicy).
  This label is described in [discussions#96](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/96).
- Exercism has a Twitter account: [@Exercism.io](https://twitter.com/exercism_io); and a mailing list: https://tinyletter.com/exercism

**Please feel free to ask any questions.  In our thinking, asking questions is far smarter than guessing.**
