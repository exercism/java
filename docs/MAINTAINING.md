## Your Permissions 

As a maintainer, you have write access to several repositories.  "write access" means you can: review, reject, accept and merge PRs; and push changes to these repos.  Despite having permissions to push directly, we tend to seek review of even our own PRs.

### Track-specific

- [java](https://github.com/exercism/java) — yeah... you know what this one is. :)

### Exercism-wide

- [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) — the library of canonical exercises.
- [discussions](https://github.com/exercism/discussions) — the place where project-wide conversations happen.

- [docs](https://github.com/exercism/docs) - the place to find project-wide documentation.
