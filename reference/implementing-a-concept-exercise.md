# How to implement a Java Concept Exercise

This document describes how to implement a Concept Exercise for the Java track.

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. So, before diving into the implementation, please read the following documents:

- [The features of v3][docs-features-of-v3].
- [Rationale for v3][docs-rationale-for-v3].
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?][docs-concept-exercises]

Please also watch the following video:

- [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise][anatomy-of-a-concept-exercise].

As this document is generic, the following placeholders are used:

- `<slug>`: the name of the exercise in snake_case (e.g. `calculator-conundrum`).
- `<concepts>`: the Concepts the exercise is about (e.g. `loops`),
- `<concept-1>`: a single Concept slug,
- `<prerequisite-n>`: a single Concept slug,
- `<uuid>`: a _new_ v4 UUID (random!)
- `<first-and-last-name>`: your first and last name (e.g. `John Doe`)
- `<git-email>`: the email address you use for git (e.g. `johndoe@email.com`)

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not). This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue. Having done this, please read the [Java Concept exercises introduction][concept-exercises]. If you have come up with something completely new, create a new issue _first_ so we can discuss the Concept Exercise.

To implement a Concept Exercise, the following files must be added:

<pre>
languages
└── java
    ├── concepts
    |   └── &lt;concept-1&gt;
    |       ├── about.md
    |       └── links.json
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;slug&gt;
                |── .docs
                |   |── instructions.md
                |   |── introduction.md
                |   |── hints.md
                |   └── source.md (required if there are third-party sources)
                |── .gitignore
                |── .meta
                |   |── design.md

                |   └── src
                |       └── reference
                |           └── java
                |               └── &lt;slug&gt;.java
                |── build.gradle
                └── src
                    |── main
                    |   └── java
                    |       └── &lt;slug&gt;.java
                    └── test
                        └── java
                            └── &lt;slug&gt;Test.java
</pre>

## Step 1: Add code files

The configuration files may be copied from another exercise. We aim to keep these in sync. We suggest to use:

- `languages/java/exercises/concept/basics/build.gradle`

Now create the following three files:

- `src/main/java/<slug>.java`. the stub implementation file, which is the starting point for students to work on the exercise.
- `src/test/java/<slug>Test.java`: the test suite, please use `assertj` to describe assertions instead of those offered by JUnit.
- `.meta/src/reference/java/<slug>.java`: an exemplar implementation that passes all the tests.

Append to `languages/java/exercises/settings.gradle` the following line: `concept:<slug>`

## Step 2: Validate the solution

Before submitting your solution, be sure it works following these two steps from the folder of your exercise:

1. Test the solution running `gradle test`
2. Validate the coding style running `gradle check`

## Step 3: Add documentation files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how to implement a concept exercise document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 4: Update list of implemented exercises

- Add the exercise to the [list of implemented exercises][implemented-exercises].

## Step 5: Add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific [analyzer][analyzer]. If so, specify what analysis rules should be applied to this exercise and why.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Step 6: Add representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an custom representation as generated by the [Java representer][representer]. If so, specify what changes to the representation should be applied and why.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at already implemented Java exercises like the strings or numbers exercises. You can also check the exercise's [general concepts documents][reference] to see if other languages have already implemented an exercise for that Concept.

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.
